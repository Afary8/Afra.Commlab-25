      <p class="w3-large">“The Last Title is Mine” is a short film set in the quiet, familiar hallway outside the NYU Abu Dhabi film screening rooms; a space lined with posters showcasing the creative work of students past and present. At first glance, it appears to be a walk through student film history. But this film isnt about the stories behind those posters, its about the titles in front of them.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Each film cover featured in the piece is treated not as a project summary, but as a symbolic chapter. The titles themselves become a narrative a sequence of names that reflect growth, agency, transformation. As the film progresses, the camera slowly zooms in, narrowing its focus, until it lands on one final title: “Still CEO B***h”</p>
      <p class="w3-large">This isnt a film about the industry. Its about identity. About authorship. It plays with the idea that in a world full of roles, scripts, and expectations, you can still choose your own title - and claim it. The setting, a hallway meant to display other peoples stories, becomes the perfect stage for telling a quiet, metaphorical one of my own.</p>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p> This film began with a simple observation: how titles alone can carry meaning, even without knowing the full story behind them. As I walked through the screening room hallway at NYUAD (a space usually meant to celebrate finished films) I started to notice how much power was held just in the names themselves. They hinted at identity, emotion, transformation.</p> 
  <p> I wanted to reframe that hallway, not as a gallery of student work, but as a narrative in progress; one that reflected not only others’ creativity, but also my own path. By isolating the titles and building momentum toward a final declaration, “Still CEO B***h” the film became about authorship, self-definition, and choosing how you want to be seen.</p>
  <p> This was a personal experiment in using existing materials to tell a new story. It’s quiet, short, and stripped down — but intentional in every frame.</p>
